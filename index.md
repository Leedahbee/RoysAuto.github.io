### About Me
I am an Undergraduate Biology Student at SNHU with prior coursework at Nova Southeastern University. I am a full time student focusing on a pre-medical school concentration while also maintaining two jobs. I work part time at Roy's Auto Sales & Service as the Marketing and Sales Manager where I manage marketing, advertizing, social media prescence, and sales as well as doing some service writing. I also work Per-deim as a Mobility Technician at Elliot Hospital. My duties at Elliot hospital include assisting and motivating patients to mobilize during their inpatient hospital stay, assiting with patient transfers and assisting with physical therapy activity orders. In my free time I enjoy painting, playing the baritone saxophone for the SNHU Wind Symphony, and spending time with my dog and family.

### Past Projects
#### [Palmer Penguins Data Analysis](https://github.com/Leedahbee/BioStatisticsAnalysis/blob/main/Palmer%20Penguins%20v2.html.md) <br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;My first foray into coding and BioStatistcs. Using the palmer penguins data set to understand how to code using R to make data tables, charts, and graphs. The Palmer Penguins Data set includes penguin population data from three islands and includes data on several factors such as species, sex, bill lengths and depths, flipper length. Other than learning more about how to use r as a coding language I also was curious whether the data set included any significant outliers, and addressed this question using the knowlege learned from the data analysis in the earlier part of the project.
